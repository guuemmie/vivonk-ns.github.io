My name is Nirmal Sarswat. I am an student engineer with a passion for building softwares.

I spend most of my time writing code and learning about new technologies. I have passion for software beacuse the technology constantly changes and advances at a rapid pace. There are always new technolgies to learn and pick up. There is no limit to what I could do and learn.

My goal is to build products that would have positive impact on millions of users everywhere around the world.

#My Background


I started learning and writing code since highschool. Since then, I have worked on multiple web and android applications. I classify myself as a Fullstack developer, both frontend and backend components. I enjoy working with the users to improve their experience with the product while expanding the functionality of the product to support that experience.


In the future, I plan to move onto learning about machine learning and deep learnign with distributed systems processing.
