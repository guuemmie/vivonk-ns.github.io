Dec 2017 – Jan 2018 | Gurgaon, IN
Apache solr | Python | Hadoop | Shell

- Shopclues is a leading e-commerce website in India. We were the team of three members improved search algorithm with implementing extra feature, merchant score, using machine learning algorithms with advanced cache system of solr search
- We implemented a m * n probabilistic search over unsupervised data with making clusters, implemented a simple match-to-match algorithm for making cluster of same type merchants for finding a product easily
- We improved data processing modules using structured algorithms, for nodes in distributed servers with the help of Apache Zookeeper

### MARWADISHAADI | SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN

May 2017 – Aug 2017 | Bombay, IN
Apache server | python | Java | shell | MySQL | PHP | Firebase

- MarwadiShaadi is a match-making web and mobile based start-up. We were the team of five people and we made there mobile applications from scratch
- Created and code Android modules from scratch, written back end in flask(python) and used MySQL database with optimized queries
- Integrated load balancer for the servers, written auto testing modules and created specific in bound and out bound rules of the firewall on the servers

### KWOC | OPEN SOURCE MENTOR

Nov 2017 – Jan 2018 | Remote, IN
Java | Python | Scrapy | Git
- KWoC is 'kharagpur winter of code' which is more likely to the Google Summer of Code. IIT KGP organize this every year, around 1000+ student get selected for the open source projects. I was a mentor in this and having 20+ mentee on 2 projects
- One project was to make crawlers for most popular search engines( Google, Yahoo, Bing and more) and popular websites(YouTube, Quora, Stackoverflow and more). Another was to make Android mobile more secure (one kind of anti-virus) in manner of privacy of data, malicious attacks, and local data sharing
- I code the initial modules of Android Application and made proxy based crawlers. Mentees work was to learn how to fix issues, add features, feel the open source power, importance of attending summits and know the open source world more deeply
